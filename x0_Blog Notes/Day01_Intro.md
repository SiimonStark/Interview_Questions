The goals of course are to better articulate the concepts and understandings of my field. That way I can better communicate with my colleagues, interviewers, and students/mentees when needed.

A secondary effect of this collection, may be that it will prove to be a good resource for new developers as an archive of interview questions.

Discovered the VSCode Ext: Quokka
